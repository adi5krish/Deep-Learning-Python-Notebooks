# Deep-Learning-Python-Notebooks
This repository contains deep learning notebooks i have made while working as a data science interns in SPRING 2019. It contains fully working code 
for various neural net architectures namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Bidirectional LSTM, CNN and RNN in tandem,
Capsule Nets. It also contains folder with code files for preprocessing train, development and test versions of ASV Spoof 2019 dataset used
while participating in the ASV Spoof 2019 Challenge.
